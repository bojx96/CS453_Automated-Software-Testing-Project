## About The Project
### Why this project?
With [Test Driven Design (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) being adopted in many AGILE workspaces, front-end developers are not spared from generating test cases that achieve the designer's requirements.

However, as webpages can contain ten to hunderds of elements, it can be really tedious to write test cases for each and everyone of them, leaving us with the question, "Can we automate this test generation?"
